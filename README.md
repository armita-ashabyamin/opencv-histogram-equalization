# opencv-histogram-equalization
This PDF is focused on histogram normalization techniques, including manual histogram equalization, OpenCVâ€™s built-in equalizeHist, and CLAHE . Through Python code and visual comparisons, the project demonstrates how each method enhances image contrast and improves visibility, especially in low-light or unevenly illuminated images.
